# Project Title
Modal Analysis of Beam and Plate: Analytical Method with Validation Using ANSYS and/or Mathematica

## Description
The project aims to develop analytical methods for determining the natural frequencies, mode shapes, and other modal parameters of beams and plates. These analytical solutions will be derived based on fundamental principles of structural mechanics and vibration theory. Furthermore, the analytical results will be validated using finite element analysis (FEA) software such as ANSYS and symbolic computation software like Mathematica.
